â€¢ Ember made a copy of this morning's dev code,
  git checkout -b EmbeRefresh
  cleared everything from the directory,
  npm init -y
  npm create vite@latest
    input "project name" as couchPotato,
      (this is temporary)
    accepted "package name" as couchPotato,
    selected "React" for "framework",
    selected "JavaScript" for "variant",
  remove package.json,
  moved everything inside couchPotato out a level into root,
    (unnesting everything)
  removed empty couchPotato,
  npm install
  npm i concurrently
  npm run dev
    confirmed on http://localhost:5173/

  * stuff in public folder is unnecessary
  * if issues, try removing package-lock.json
